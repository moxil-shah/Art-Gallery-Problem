# Isovist Sandox
[Isovist Sandbox](https://moxil-shah.github.io/Isovist-Sandbox/) is a website that allows
users to experiment with different kinds
of isovists for different kinds of polygons.

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isovist), 
"a single isovist is the volume of space visible from a given point in space, 
together with a specification of the location of that point." Frankly, I don't have a better definition.
